//* first script tag here is basically the core React library.
//* this one is the one that works with components, state, and really all the React stuff.
//* basically the interface of how to interact with React.
//! This script allows us to use React object and its methods
//?React.createElement

//* The second one this is React-dom is basically the rendering layer which can render React components into the dom.
//* And so since we want to render in the browser, we need to use React-dom.
//* But React can actually be rendered in other environments, for example, as native applications using React Native.
//! This script allows us to use ReactDOM object and its methods such as:
//? ReactDOM.createRoot

//* React is based on components. And a component is basically just a function that starts with an upper case
function App() {}

//* To check your node version
//* node -v

//* To create react app
//* npx create-react-app@5 pizza-menu

//* to start react project:
//* npm run start or just npm start

//* hi

//* hoi
