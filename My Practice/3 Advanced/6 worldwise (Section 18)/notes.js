// now as you learned in the previous lecture

// just because you now know how to use the context API

// that doesn't mean that it's always the right tool

// or the right solution

// for managing the state in your applications.
// when you have a small sized application

// like this one that we are building right now and where

// performance is never going to be an issue, then

// the context API is a great tool indeed.

//* 1) Create context folder
//* 2) Create citiesContext.jsx
//* 3) create CitiesContext and Cities provider function comp
//* 4) Grab all state code and state updating code from App.jsx and place inside Cities provider function com
