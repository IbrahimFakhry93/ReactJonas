//!  313. Modeling the "User" State With Redux Toolkit

// this user state is going to be global UI state.

// And the reason for that is that we need that state

// in many places in the application tree.

//^============================================================================

// So we are going to need it up there in the header.

// So at least if the app is large enough,

// so we need it right here.

// We also need it for this component here.

// So to decide if we want to display this one here

// and also to then update the name.

// Also, we need the username right here and even right here.

// So then we can automatically pre-populate this input field

// with that username.

//* npm i reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
