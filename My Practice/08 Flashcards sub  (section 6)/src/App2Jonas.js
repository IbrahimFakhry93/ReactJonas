  //! If you want the previously selected card to revert back to its question state when a new card is selected,

  //* This way, the parent component can keep track of which card is selected and control the state of all cards.

//* Jonas Solution:

//? to avoid the return keyword in map method put ()
//? as here
//~ questions.map(question => (<div>
//~ </div >))

// {questions.map(question =>(
//   <div key={question.id} className={question.id === selectedId ? 'selected' : ''} onClick={() => handleClick(question.id)}>
//   {question.id === selectedId? <p>{question.answer}</p> : <p>{question.question}</p>}
//  </div>)
// )
// }

//! Very important note:

//? My bug of flash cards in App.js (App.js is my work):

//! bug
//! when click on a second flash card after the first selected one,
//! the first flash card keeps its style on answer style (isn't flipped to question again)

//* This bug occurs because each Card component maintains its own state.
//* When you click on a card, youâ€™re changing the state of that specific card,
//* not the state of all cards.

//* The selected state is unique to each card. When you select a new card,
//* the previously selected card retains its state.
//* Since nothing is causing the previous card to re-render (like a click event),
//* it remains in its current state, which is displaying the answer.

//? Jonas solution in App2.js as above solves this bug:

//! If you want the previously selected card to revert back to its question state when a new card is selected,
//* you would need to lift the state up to the parent component (FlashCards).
//* This way, the parent component can keep track of which card is selected and control the state of all cards.
//* When a new card is selected, the parent component can reset the state of the previously selected card.
