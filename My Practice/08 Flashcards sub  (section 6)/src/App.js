  //! bug of placing selected state in the Card component not Parent component.
  //! when click on a second flash card after the first selected one,
  //! the first flash card keeps its style on answer style (isn't flipped to question again)

  //* This bug occurs because each Card component maintains its own state.
  //* When you click on a card, youâ€™re changing the state of that specific card,
  //* not the state of all cards.

  //* The selected state is unique to each card. When you select a new card,
  //* the previously selected card retains its state.
  //* Since nothing is causing the previous card to re-render (like a click event),
  //* it remains in its current state, which is displaying the answer.
